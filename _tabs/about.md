Hey there! I'm a hacker by trait with a passion for all things cybersecurity, but my desk job is Cyber Risk Analyst. My world revolves around understanding systems and finding their hidden vulnerabilities â€“ a mindset I bring both to my professional work and my personal pursuits.

When I'm not diving deep into risk assessments, you'll likely find me building out my latest home lab, honing my penetration testing skills, or exploring the fascinating world of hacking. I'm an insatiable learner, constantly absorbing new knowledge through books, audiobooks, and podcasts. Beyond the digital realm, I love trying out new things, whether it's capturing moments through photography, getting lost in music, or pushing my limits with a good workout.
