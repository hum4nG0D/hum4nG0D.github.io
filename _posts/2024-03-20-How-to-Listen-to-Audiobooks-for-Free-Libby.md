If youâ€™ve been wanting to read more books or get into audiobooks but the cost is holding you back. Good news: you *donâ€™t* have to spend a dime. Forget about expensive audiobook subscriptions or buying paperback books outright (unless thatâ€™s your thing). Thereâ€™s a much better way, and itâ€™s all *completely free*.

Hereâ€™s one of my favorite software: **Libby**.

### ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Libby?

Libby is a free app by OverDrive that lets you borrow eBooks, audiobooks, and even magazines using your library card. It's available on Android, iOS, Kindle, and browser and the best part? It supports multiple library cards, which means you can tap into an enormous catalog of content from *different libraries at the same time.*

### ðŸ”‘ My current setup: 3 Libraries (or more) in One App

![Libby List](/assets/img/libby/libby-list.png)

Right now, Iâ€™ve got **three** libraries linked to my Libby account:

1. **National Library Board (NLB), Singapore**
   
    Yep, even though Iâ€™ve moved away, my old NLB account still works. Itâ€™s loaded with a solid collection of both local and international titles.
    
2. **Department of Defense (DoD) MWR Digital Library**
   
    If you're affiliated with the military, this is a goldmine. Tons of technical books, leadership reads, self-help, and even bestsellers, free for service members and families.
    
3. **My Local County Library (US)**
   
    Most U.S. public libraries now support Libby. All you need is a library card, and you're in. I was surprised at how many audiobooks and Kindle-compatible eBooks were available locally.
    

These three together give me access to hundreds of thousands of books and audiobooks on-demand and for FREE.

### ðŸŽ§ Why Pay for Books When You Can Read for FREE?

Donâ€™t get me wrong: buying books and supporting authors is great. And if you love owning physical copies or want to collect audiobooks on Audible, go for it. But if youâ€™re just trying to read more or squeeze audiobooks into your commute (like I do), there's honestly *no reason to pay* when Libby exists.

Audiobooks for long drives? âœ…

eBooks for flights or downtime? âœ…

Magazines and reference books? âœ…

### ðŸ”§ Tips

- **Hold lists**: Popular titles may have a waitlist, but if youâ€™re connected to multiple libraries, you can often find the same book available elsewhere.
- **Download for offline use**: Perfect for flights or data-conscious listening.
- **Adjust playback speed**: 1.5x or 2x for those who want to blaze through nonfiction.

Before you sign up for yet another subscription or drop money on a $15 audiobook, check Libby first. Chances are, the book you want is already available and free, through one of your local or eligible libraries. So go ahead, stack up your library cards, download Libby, and let your reading habit flourish *without* breaking the bank.
