As a person who never really is a fan of ads, I have been trying to use all sorts of ad blocking softwares from in browser extension to standalone apps. For the most part, they are a hit or miss. I just want to read an article sometimes or I just want to play a short video clip but then all kinds of ads flying around the site and shouting it to my face. I don't mind supporting content creators but it's just getting out of hand most of the time.

I have just been started using AdGuard and I can say that it's nothing like a conventional Adblocker. It's an adblocker that does more than just a regular adblocker. Usually, for an effective ad blocking, I use adblocker extension (safari, chrome & firefox) and a pop-up blocker. Even then, some ads manage to come through and pop-up pages still show. AdGuard does that so effortlessly, doesn't matter what browser I use, it will still block ads and pop-ups and works like a charm. There are three levels it can be configured into from comfortable level to paranoid level ad blocking which is really effective when you don't want to see a single ad. Ads can also be blocked manually in any case if there are any ads still lying around the site.

From a security perspective, any blocking is a good blocking. AdGuard has a build-in security feature which can warn users of phishing sites and malware infected sites. This is a bonus feature on top of adblocker which other adblockers simply do not have. AdGuard is not claiming to be an antivirus so you will still need your antivirus software to protect against potential virus/ malware infections.

AdGuard can automatically filter HTTP traffic with a kernel level extension. And it can even be used as an HTTP proxy so all the traffic can be filtered through AdGuard.

AdGuard is highly recommended to users of any level from a casual user to a highly technical user. In time of Covid-19 and work from home, the last thing we need is a random pop-up ads that doesn't correlate to any of your interest and it's already 2021.
