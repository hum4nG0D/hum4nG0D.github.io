### *A Practical Side Project for Real-World Cyber Threat Intelligence*

In the age of AI-assisted development, I challenged myself to build something that not only showcases technical skills but also solves a real problem I face everyday. That’s how *CVE Hunter* was born.

As a cybersecurity professional, I frequently look up CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). But here's the issue: the information I need is fragmented across the internet. One website has CVSS scores but no exploit data, another has exploit references but lacks EPSS probabilities, and CVEDetails—once a go-to source—now hides most useful features behind a paywall. It was frustrating.

So I decided to build a unified CVE intelligence dashboard that aggregates all the relevant details I care about—faster, cleaner, and AI-powered.



## **Step 1: Setting Up the CVE Data Pipeline (NVD API)**

I started with the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**, which offers a public API for querying CVEs. To make queries faster and more flexible, I wrote a Python script that:

- Pulls CVE data via the NVD API
- Saves all CVEs in a local database (with full JSON blob for flexibility)

Scripts and database setup guide can be found here: [https://github.com/hum4nG0D/nvd_sync](https://github.com/hum4nG0D/nvd_sync)

- Auto-syncs every 3 hours to fetch new or modified CVEs (NVD’s limit is 1 request every 2 hours)

This created a robust and scalable backend to power the rest of the application.



## **Step 2: Building the CVE Hunter Interface**

With the data foundation in place, I started designing the frontend with a clean, focused UI. The core interface includes:

- **CVE Search Bar** (by ID or keyword)
- **CVE Details** (summary, publish date, vendor info)
- **Mitigation Tips** (if available)
- **EPSS Scores** (for real-world exploit probability)
- **CVSS Scores** (base, temporal, and environmental)
- **CWE Data** (classification of the vulnerability)
- **Known Exploits** (links to Proof of Concept code, malware usage, etc.)
- **Risk Matrix** (custom scoring based on impact and likelihood)
- **References** (blog posts, vendor advisories, security research)
- **AI-Powered Analysis** (using OpenAI API to summarize the threat, suggest mitigations, and even generate detection ideas)

The result? A single-pane-of-glass for CVE analysis.



## **Step 3: Design & Extras**

I themed the app with a **Cyberpunk aesthetic**, to keep the vibe fresh and developer-friendly. To make the platform more robust, I added **Shodan CVE data**, which brings in exploit context—whether the CVE is being actively exploited, associated with ransomware, or exposed in the wild.



## **What the Site Shows Today**

Honestly? I’m pretty happy with how it turned out.



## **Roadmap: What’s Next**

This is just the beginning. Here’s what I plan to add next:

- 🗺️ **Shodan Search Integration with Interactive Map**
  
    Visualize IPs, locations, and open ports tied to CVEs in real time.
    
- 🔗 **More Threat Intel Sources**
  
    Integrate APIs from vendors like GreyNoise, AlienVault OTX, and Recorded Future for richer context.
    
- 🔍 **Full-text CVE Search & Filters**
  
    Severity, vendor, exploitability score, affected product—you name it.
    
- 🔐 **Red Team/Blue Team Tabs**
  
    Different views for defensive mitigations vs. offensive testing strategies.

*CVE Hunter* started as a side project, but it quickly became something I now use everyday. It not only saves time, but it also improves the depth of my CVE analysis by combining structured data with AI insights.

It’s a reminder that even small personal projects—when built with intention—can have a big impact.
